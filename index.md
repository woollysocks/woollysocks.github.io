Hi! I'm an NLP researcher with a PhD in Data Science from New York University's Center for Data Science (CDS) where I was advised by [Sam Bowman](https://www.nyu.edu/projects/bowman/). My research has focused on data-creation and crowdsourcing methodologies for NLP model evaluation. I'm currently working on NLP data and eval things at AWS. 

Prior to venturing in NLP, I did R&D for a few year at a start-up after graduating from the University of Chicago in 2013 with a Bachelor's in Physics. While in the Physics world, I studied and researched in experimental high energy.

I will be setting up a regular office hours soon, in the mean time if you want to chat about research, or academia, or NYU, or industry, you can reach me at <nikitanangia@gmail.com>. 



### Publications
Here's my _[Google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DoXtjzcAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao)_ for an up-to-date list of publications.


<!-- ### NYU AI School
Aside from research, I've been one of the primary organizers of the [NYU AI School](https://nyu-mll.github.io/nyu-ai-school-2021/) since we started it in 2019. Our focus with this week-long program is to introduce college students from underrepresented groups to machine learning. We hope to demystify the field and make it approachable, encouraging more students to pursue work and studies in ML. -->
